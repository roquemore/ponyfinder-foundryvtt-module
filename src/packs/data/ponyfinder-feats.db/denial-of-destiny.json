When you roll a natural 1 on a d20 and have no hero points, you gain a hero point. There must be consequences for rolling the 1 (even simple failure to proceed). You may take this feat even if you have another spirit tribe feat. Lose the benefit of any other spirit tribe feats you have, which you may retrain as normal.</p>"
