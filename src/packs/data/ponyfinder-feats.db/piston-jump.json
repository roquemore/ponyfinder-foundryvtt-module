When performing a @Compendium[pf2e.actionspf2e.High Jump]{High Jump}, you can jump two feet higher and, on a critical success, you can jump five additional feet higher. When you fail, it is always considered as if you landed on a soft substance. If you are an expert in Acrobatics, double these numbers. If you are legendary, treat critical failures to jump as failures instead.</p>"
