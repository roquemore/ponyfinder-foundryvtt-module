The effect is constant and subtle, giving just a touch of life where once there was none. Used purposefully, you may, once a day, cause an effect like the <em>@Compendium[pf2e.spells-srd.ZhJ8d9Uk4lwIx86b]</em> ritual with you serving as the only caster, causing plants to erupt from you in a sudden wave of life and vibrance. This is a [three-actions] activity with the manipulate trait. When you or an ally within the radius of the effect is using Survival to find food, water, or stave off natural hazards, they enjoy a +2 status bonus to the check. If you have used this effect before within 30 days, your Nature check suffers a -2 penalty per previous time you've used it.</p>"
